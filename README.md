### Project Overview

You will be doing four unit projects and one final project in this class. Have a look at the project timeline in [the projects folder](./projects/). Information about the projects will be announced in class and upploaded to the folder.

The final project should represent significant original work applying data science techniques to an interesting problem. Final projects are individual attainments, but you should be talking frequently with your instructor and classmates about them.

Address a data-related problem in your professional field or a field you're passionate about. If you have a strong interest in the subject matter, you'll create a better project and it will be a lot more fun for you!

Here's a collection of [past projects](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=) from GA Data Science students that may help to stimulate your thinking. You're welcome to use [Github public datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets), [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or private data, though with private data, you'll have to be careful about what you release. Competing in a [Kaggle competition](http://www.kaggle.com/) (including past competitions) is also a project option, in which case the data will be provided for you.


## Development Environment

Start with your Windows or Mac Terminal app:

Type the following into your terminal...

1. Navigate to the folder in which you have your python notebook (using `cd`).
2. Run `jupyter notebook 'filename.ipynb'` (Alternatively, you can run `jupyter notebook` and browse for the file using the web interface)
3. Kill Jupyter after you’re done by doing a `Ctrl-C` on the same window terminal you ran `jupyter notebook` from. Then type 'y' and press Enter.
